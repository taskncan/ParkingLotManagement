## Abstract

There is an expanding firm in business of multi-storey parking lots. This firm owns one parking lot at the moment, yet looking for an opportunity to expand, therefore is in need for a system to manage all parking lots it owns at once.

This system stores and monitor firm details, costumer informations, parking lots' informations, usage rates, accounting data; and allow users to manage the lots or their membership information.

## Detailed Information

Parking lot(s) have parking spots for cars, motorcycles and bikes. They also have charging spots for electrical cars and electrical motorcycles. Parking lot(s) may have couple areas designated to be rented to 3rd party entrepreneurs for small shops like car wash, caf√© or lounge. 

While entering the parking lot, information of total number of empty spots on that very floor and floors above or below for each vehicle type should be given to the driver, biker or cyclist. This information should be updated real-time. Usage information (occupancy ratio) per hour per day of the whole parking lot should be kept at the database for at least three months, so this data can be used to show statistics of usage ratio.

### Parking
Parking spots will have a parking meter per spot. They will;
   - be able to detect parked vehicle,
   - be able to read vehicle plate number,
   - have NFC to reach customer memberships and wallet account,
   - be able to accept credit card and cash.
Parking fees may vary from one parking lot to another. For base prices see Table 1.

| Vehicle    | Starting Fee       | Added Fee (after one hour) |
